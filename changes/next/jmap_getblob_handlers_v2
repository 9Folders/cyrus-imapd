Description:

This PR changes the profile of the jmap_getblob_handler()s to only return the blob
data and content-type, and leaves the final disposition of the data (output on the
wire or otherwise) up to the calling process.

This PR also removes support for the 'G' conv.db hack to support blobIds for the
image data in vCard PHOTO properties and replaces it with a new variant of the
'V' smart blobId which is more jmap_getblob_handler() friendly.

Finally, this rework allows the use of blobs other than those that are uploaded
to be used as contact avatars (vCard PHOTOs), such as BIMI indicator blobs.
