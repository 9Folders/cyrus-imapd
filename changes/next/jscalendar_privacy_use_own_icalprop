Description:

Maps JMAP CalendarEvent privacy to the newly introduced iCalendar
X-JMAP-PRIVACY property rather than CLASS.

Config changes:

None.

Upgrade instructions:

Previous versions of Cyrus determined the JMAP CalendarEvent privacy of
an iCalendar VEVENT by the CLASS property. This now gets determined by
the newly introduced X-JMAP-PRIVACY property, but the CalDAV indexes may
already have entries for the old mapping and need to be upgraded.

Sites that use JMAP should upgrade their CalDAV database index by calling
the newly introduced JMAP method `Admin/rewriteCalendarEventPrivacy`.
This method:

- requires the 'https://cyrusimap.org/ns/jmap/admin' request capability
- must be called as an admin user (regular user calls are rejected)
- takes the optional `userIds` argument, whis is a JSON array of
  userids to migrate. In absence of this argument, all users are migrated

Site that do not use JMAP should upgrade their CalDAV database by

- calling 'DELETE FROM ical_objs WHERE comp_flags >= 1024;' on a user's
  dav.db
- followed by calling `dav_reconstruct` for that user
