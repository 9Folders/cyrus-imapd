Description:

master(8) now touches a ready file to indicate it is "ready for work"
master(8) now gets its pidfile name from master_pid_file imapd.conf option


Config changes:

* master_pid_file
* master_ready_file


Upgrade instructions:

If you have something that monitors syslog looking for master's
"ready for work" message, you might consider switching to monitoring
the master.ready file instead, perhaps using Linux inotify.

The master pidfile name is now read from imapd.conf, and defaults
to ``{configdirectory}/master.pid``.  If you have something that
looks for this file, you should either update it to look in the new
default location, or set ``master_pid_file`` in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)`
to override the default.  The ``-p`` option to :cyrusman:`master(8)`
can still be used to override it.
