Description:

master(8) now touches a ready file to indicate it is "ready for work"


Config changes:

* master_ready_file


Upgrade instructions:

If you have something that monitors syslog looking for master's
"ready for work" message, you might consider switching to monitoring
the master.ready file instead, perhaps using Linux inotify.
