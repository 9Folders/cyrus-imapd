Description:

Copying/moving messages from split conversations is now correct.


Config changes:

No config changes needed.


Upgrade instructions:

This is all backwards compatible, but a conversations DB rebuild will
be good, e.g. `ctl_conversationsdb -R -r -v`.

If a user remains broken, you can wipe and recreate all their CIDs with
`ctl_conversationsdb -z $username` followed by
`ctl_conversationsdb -b $username`
