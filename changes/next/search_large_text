Description:

Improves search index and snippet generation latency by stopping early
for overlong text.

Config changes:

Adds the `search_maxsize` option. The formerly hardcoded maximum size of
4Mb is kept as the default value.

Includes the new `X-Truncate-Size` HTTP header in requests to the attachment
body extractor service. The value of this header is `search_maxsize` in bytes.

Upgrade instructions:

The former implementation applied the search_maxsize limit to the total of
email bodies that contain text. This patch changes this to apply the limit
to each body part separately. This may result in larger search indexes.
