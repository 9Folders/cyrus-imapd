Description:

Adds pcre2 support.  Prefers pcre2 over pcre if both are available.


Config changes:

None


Upgrade instructions:

Cyrus will prefer pcre2 over pcre if both are installed.  If you have both
installed and wish to use pcre rather than pcre2, run configure with
--disable-pcre2.

If you haven't specifically installed libpcre2-dev (or whatever your system's
equivalent is), you might still have parts of pcre2 installed due to other
packages on your system depending on it.  This can confuse configure into
thinking you have a usable pcre2 when you don't.  Either properly install
libpcre2-dev so Cyrus can use it, or configure Cyrus with --disable-pcre2
so that it ignores the partial installation.

Please note that on Debian-based systems, pcre (the old one, no longer
maintained) is called "pcre3".  Yes, this is confusing.
