Description:

Adds a new BYTESIZE smart type for imapoptions that set sizes


Config changes:

Adds a new BYTESIZE smart type for imapoptions that set sizes.  This allows
sizes to be specified in "KB", etc for better readability.

These imapd.conf options are changed in some way:

* archive_maxsize
* autocreate_quota
* autocreatequota
* backup_compact_minsize
* backup_compact_maxsize
* event_content_size
* icalendar_max_size
* jmap_preview_length
* jmap_max_size_upload
* jmap_max_size_blob_set
* jmap_max_size_request
* jmap_mail_max_size_attachments_per_email
* maxmessagesize
* maxquoted
* maxword
* quotawarn -> quotawarnpercent
* quotawarnkb -> quotawarnsize
* search_maxsize
* sieve_maxscriptsize
* vcard_max_size
* webdav_attachments_max_binary_attach_size


Upgrade instructions:

This feature is transparent over upgrade and downgrade, provided the
imapd.conf remains unchanged.

Admins may update their imapd.conf to take advantage of the readability of the
new smart type, but after doing so will no longer be able to downgrade to a
version without this feature (unless they also revert their imapd.conf).
