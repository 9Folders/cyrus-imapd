Description:

Rewrites JMAP calendar default alarms to a non-DAV mailbox annotation.


Config changes:

None.


Upgrade instructions:

Installations that use the experimental JMAP calendars API need run a
migration tool to separate CalDAV default alarm annotations from
JMAP annotations.

Currently, JMAP default alarms are stored on a calendar mailbox
in the following annotations:

- {urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav}default-alarm-vevent-datetime
- {urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav}default-alarm-vevent-date

After migration, these annotations are removed from the calendar
mailbox and their contents moved to the Cyrus-internal annotation

- /vendor/cmu/cyrus-jmap/defaulalerts

CalDAV annotations on the calendar home are left as-is and are not
migrated. Typically, Apple CalDAV clients store default alarms at
this location.

To migrate, call the following JMAP method as an admin user:

# Admin/migrateCalendarDefaultAlarms

This method has the following arguments:

- userIds: Id[]|null (default: null): the list of users for which to
  migrate default alarms. If null, then alarms are migrated for all users.

- keepCaldavAlarms: Boolean (default: false): If true, the DAV annotations
  are migrated but not removed from the calendar mailbox. There should be
  no need to keep them, except if installations or their CalDAV clients
  made use of these CalDAV annotations themselves.

The method response contains:

- migrated: Id[String[SetError|null]]: For each userid, this is a map of
  calendar id to either null on success, or an error.

- notMigrated: Id[SetError]: For each userid, contains an error that
  prevented migrating this users default alarms.


GitHub issue:

None.
